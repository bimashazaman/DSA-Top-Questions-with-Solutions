# Validate Subsequence โข ยง
# Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

# A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4] . Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
